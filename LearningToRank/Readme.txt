1. Use RankLib to complete baseline: supervised learning.
2. Exploit page similarity and/or domain or other meta-information link structure data provided to improve ranking over the baseline.
Train a fully connected NN or CNN using Tensorflow or Pytorch to try to "discover" additional features and then take use of RankLib.
